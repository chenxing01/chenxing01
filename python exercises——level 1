Question 1
Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Solution:
list=[]
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7==0 and i%5!=0:
        list.append(i)
print(list)

Question 2
Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
#使用for循环
number=input()
number=int(number)
result=1
if number<0:
    print("你输入的数字有误")
elif number==0:
    print("0的阶乘为1")
else:
    for i in range(1,number+1):
        result*=i
        print(result)
        
#使用factorial函数
number=input()
number=int(number)
result=math.factorial(number)
print(result)

#使用递归
